# freecodecamp

This is a repo to contain an additional record of some of my completed projects/exercises. Of course they are stored on the fcc site... 

My intent for this repp is not to provide answers for others to copy, but to remind myself of the progress I have made, and have some things on hand that may come in handy in the future.

Completing fcc has been too long in the making. I began fcc a few years ago, and kept diverting my attention elsewhere...
