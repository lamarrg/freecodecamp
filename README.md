# freecodecamp

This is a repo to contain an additional record of some of my completed projects/exercises. Of course they are stored on the fcc site...

This is a completion that has been too long in the making. I began FCC a few years ago, and kept getting sidetracked. Plus, a lot of their content is JavaScript based. That is an area I am not very interested in, nor perform well in.
